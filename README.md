There are four files in this folder:

1. election-data-analysis.R (the code for the analysis provided in the Medium post)
   - All the material from the post is hosted [here](https://github.com/ssriva1998/das2023_repl/blob/main/election-data-analysis.R).

2. ReanalyseCode_SM.R (my own script)

3. All_States_GE.csv (the main dataset)
